##Chapter 7, Question 21
##How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is Watanabe? 
#You can assume that the first name that comes before it will always be one word that begins with a capital letter. The regex must match the following:
#'Haruto Watanabe'
#'Alice Watanabe'
#'RoboCop Watanabe'
import re
pattern=r'^[A-Z]{1}[a-zA-Z]+\s{1}Watanabe$'
m=re.search(pattern, input())
if m:
    print(m.group(0))
else:
    print('no match')
