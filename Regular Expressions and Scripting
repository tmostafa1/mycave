Using a text editor of your choice (see text editor lists in the 'Further resources' section), use regular expressions to perform the following tasks on the Project Gutenberg version of Defoeâ€™s A Journal of the Plague Year:

Find all instances of the word bridge.
Solution:
def find_bridge(text):
    text=text.read() #read the text
    for word in text: #iterate through each word in the text
        match=re.search(r'\sbridge\s', word)  #specify the pattern to be searched as an object of the search function
    if match: # if a match of the pattern is found
        print (match.group(0)) #print the entire match
    else: #otherwise
        print('didnot find') #print didn't find
    
text=open('F:\OneDriveGSU\OneDrive - Georgia State University\Python_practice\Gutenberg.txt', 'r')
find_bridge(text)  #function call
