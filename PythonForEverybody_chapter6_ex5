#Exercise 5: Take the following Python code that stores a string:‘
#str = ’X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475’
#Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the colon
#character and then use the float function to convert the extracted string into a
#floating point number.
a = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'
index=a.find('0')
my_str=a[index:]
print(float(my_str))
