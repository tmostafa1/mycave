###1. For the --count flag, implement a print_words(filename) function that counts
#how often each word appears in the text and prints:
#word1 count1
#word2 count2
#...

#Print the above list in order sorted by word (python will sort punctuation to
#come before letters -- that's fine). Store all the words as lowercase,
#so 'The' and 'the' count as the same word.

def print_words(filename):
    d={}
    text=open(filename)
    text=text.read()
    text=text.strip().lower().split()
    for i in text:
        d[i]=text.count(i)    
    for k in sorted(d):
        print(k, d[k])
